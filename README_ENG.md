WildBerries Tech Entry level, I wish I had officially gotten it, but in the weeks of replying to their vacancy, my resume has not been reviewed. It's not a big deal, but because of that I can't be 100% sure of the correctness, as they were not checked by wb developers. Based on comments from interns I know, the main difficulty was not in solving them, but in understanding goroutines and Golang itself.

The tasks include work with both goroutines and classical algorithms. I'm +- confident they are correct, but the most important work was done under the hood. More specifically, watched several interviews, video lectures, visited a bunch of forums, etc to form a huge body of information about go + backend development at the intern/junior levels. It turned out to be almost 20+ A4 pages of small print.
